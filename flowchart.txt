1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset
    - Tweet Hate Data
3. Visualization
    - Sample Outcome
    - Wordcloud
4. Data Processing
    - Removing the URL and other characters
    - Remove Punctuations
    - Remove Stops words
    - Normalization the data	
    - Lemmation
    - Stemming

5. Tokenization
    - CounterVectorizer

9. Training the Model 
10. Building the model 

Flask Framework
=============

11. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
12. Importing the packages
13. User gives input 
14. The given input is preprocessed for prediction
15. Trained model is used for prediction 
16. Along with that we Applied LDA model for Topic Modelling
17. Final outcome is displayed through frontend

Dataset
=======
Used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vkrahul/twitter-hate-speech  

Extension
=======
In the base paper, the author mentioned to use different techniques for analysis the datasets for predicting the hate speech with different models,

As an extension we applied an ensemble method  combining the predictions of multiple individual models to produce a more robust and accurate final prediction.
However, we can further enhance the performance by exploring other ensemble techniques such as Stacking Classifier and LSTM + BiGRU for analysis Dataset, in which may get 99% of accuracy,
With the above As an extension we can build the front end using flask framework for user testing with authentication.
